# Polling App Project Brief

## Project Overview
A modern, interactive polling application that allows users to create, share, and participate in polls with real-time results and community engagement features.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Features
- **Poll Creation**: Users can create polls with multiple options, descriptions, and customizable settings
- **Poll Participation**: Users can vote on polls and see live results
- **Real-time Updates**: Live vote counting and result visualization
- **Community Engagement**: Public and private polls with social sharing features
- **User Management**: Authentication system for poll creators and voters

### Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Database**: Supabase with PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with RLS policies
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks with server actions
- **Real-time**: Supabase real-time subscriptions

### Quality Standards
- **Performance**: Server-side rendering for optimal loading speeds
- **Security**: Row-level security, input validation, and secure authentication
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant components and keyboard navigation
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design that works across all devices
- **Maintainability**: Clean code structure with reusable components

## Success Criteria

### User Experience Goals
1. **Ease of Use**: Poll creation should take less than 2 minutes
2. **Engagement**: High participation rates with intuitive voting experience
3. **Discovery**: Easy browsing and filtering of community polls
4. **Management**: Simple poll management for creators (edit/delete)

### Technical Goals
1. **Scalability**: Handle thousands of concurrent users and polls
2. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with robust error handling
3. **Security**: Secure authentication and data protection
4. **Performance**: Sub-second response times for all interactions

## Project Scope

### Phase 1 (Current)
- Basic poll creation and voting functionality
- User authentication and profiles
- Dashboard with recent polls
- Poll management (edit/delete for owners)

### Future Phases
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Poll templates and categories
- Mobile app development
- API for third-party integrations
- Advanced voting features (multiple votes, anonymous voting)

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must use Supabase for backend services
- Must follow Next.js App Router patterns
- Must maintain server/client component separation
- Must use TypeScript for type safety

### Business Assumptions
- Free tier with premium features planned
- Community-driven content model
- Mobile-responsive design priority
- Internationalization support planned

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Implement proper indexing and query optimization
- **Real-time Scaling**: Monitor and optimize Supabase real-time connections
- **Authentication Security**: Regular security audits and updates

### Product Risks
- **User Adoption**: Focus on user experience and onboarding
- **Content Quality**: Implement moderation tools and community guidelines
- **Platform Abuse**: Rate limiting and spam prevention measures

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Daily active users
- Poll creation rate
- Average votes per poll
- User retention rates

### Technical Performance
- Page load times (<2 seconds)
- API response times (<500ms)
- Error rates (<0.1%)
- Real-time update latency (<1 second)
